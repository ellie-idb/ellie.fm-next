# ud2.sh-next

This is the repository that contains the source code for what's currently hosted on [ud2.sh](https://ud2.sh).

This website is an evolution on top of my previous work (see: [ud2.sh](https://github.com/hatf0/ud2.sh)), including some neat features like an integrated Linux emulator, allowing you to play shareware Doom via my website.

## Building
Any changes made to the `master` branch are automatically deployed by Vercel.

## Development
Run `npm run dev` to test changes on a local dev server, or alternatively run `npm run build && npm run start` to 
build & run a production version of the website.
