Hi! As you've probably seen, I'm Harrison, a 20 y/o site reliability engineer currently working at Paradoxum Games & Synapse Softworks LLC.

I'm all over the place with what I do in my free time: network engineering (my AS number is AS395388), hardware hacking, reverse engineering, infrastructure engineering, rock climbing, etc. I don't consider myself a jack of all trades, but moreso that I quickly learn and adapt to any role as needed.

At Paradoxum, I work on infrastructure & metrics / analytics for Tower Defense Simulator, which is a tower defense game built on the Roblox platform with over 2.9 billion visits, and over 3.2 million unique users per month. At peak, we see 120k+ concurrent users playing Tower Defense Simulator, 18k requests made per second, and 1+ million data points generated per second.
Needless to say, a *lot* of players.

At Synapse, I help with our recently announced partnership with the Roblox corporation, where I build low-level network tooling for our team to use. Before that, I helped work on Synapse X, which was a script execution software with over 70k+ daily active users. Synapse X regularly saw 150+ TB/mo of traffic, so I had to learn how to manage that and stop our backend from getting overwhelmed.

Prospective employers: I'm always open to helping solve novel & interesting challenges. If you have a role that you think I'd be a great fit for, please send an email my way! You can find my resume in the resume.pdf file, and my email in the contact_me.txt file. Thanks!
