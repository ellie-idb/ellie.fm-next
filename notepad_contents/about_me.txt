Hi! As you've probably seen, I'm Harrison - a 19 year old software engineer.

This is my personal website, designed using the fantastic React95 component set, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

Feel free to explore around, but keep in mind that this website is a work in progress, and that I'm adding more & more content as time goes on.
