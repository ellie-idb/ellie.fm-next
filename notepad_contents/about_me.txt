Hi! As you've probably seen, I'm Harrison - a 20 year old software engineer, currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

This is my personal website, designed using the fantastic React95 component set, Next.js, Vercel, and Tailwind CSS.

Feel free to explore around, but keep in mind that this website is a work in progress, and that I'm always adding more & more content as time goes on.

Prospective employers: I'm always open to helping solve novel & interesting challenges. If you have a role that you think I'd be a great fit for, please send an email my way! You can find my email in the contact_me.txt file.
